# DS 2.2 Deep Learning

Artificial Inteligence is the capability of a machine
to imitate intelligent human behavior.

Machine Learning is good for tabular data, however
Deep Learning shows very good results for raw data
ex: (images, text, voice speech)

Deep Learning can extract features.
because of more degrees of freedom,
we can obtain more sophisticated decision regions

**Supervised Learning**
Split Data -> training, testing
Input variables
Output variables
Algorithm for mapping the function
from the input ot the output.

**Unsupervised Learning**
High Intra-Class Similarity
Low Intra-Class Similarity
Train model using information that is neither classified nor labelled
K means clustering

**Reinforcement Learning**
Machine learns with experience
Action
Enviorment
Reward

## Important Terms

**Vector**
1D number of arguments in horizontal/vertical order

**Matrix**
2D arrangement of numbers

**Tensor**
3D
ex: RGB
